## Project decription
Max Â½ page. Include some information on:
- what dataset you plan to use
- goal of the project. 

My Project is to use develop and train a neural network to segment the trabecular space of the distal femur in mice. The dataset that I plan on using for this project will be gathering images of the kneee joint from a dataset of CT scans from Mendeley Data. Though if possible, I would like to use mice knee joint scans from past projects through my research lab. Either way one of these two datasets will be used.

The goal of the project is to be able to generate a highleighted area that serves as a representation of the trabecular space of the knee joint. Then after segmenting throughout the images that make up knee scan, the trabecular volume, mass, and density can be generated based on the size of the highlighted area in the images generated.
