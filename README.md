## Project decription
My Project is to  develop and train a neural network to segment the trabecular space of the distal femur in mice. The dataset that I plan on using for this project will be knee joint images that are gathered from a dataset of CT scans of mice knee joints found on Mendeley Data, after recieving the scans I will perform segmentation of the trabecular space using Dragonfly3D or Slicer so that I can train the AI using segmented images. Though, if possible, I would like to use mice knee joint scans from past projects through my research lab, the segmentation process will be the same. Either way one of these two datasets will be used.

The goal of the project is to be able to generate a highlighted area that serves as a representation of the trabecular space of the knee joint. Then after segmenting throughout the images that make up knee scan, the trabecular volume, mass, and density can be generated based on the size of the highlighted area in the images generated. From this data predictions about the mice's health can be generated.
