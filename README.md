## Project decription
Max Â½ page. Include some information on:
- what dataset you plan to use
- goal of the project. 

My Project is to use develop and train a neural network to segment the trabecular space of the distal femur in mice. The dataset that I plan on using for this project will be gathering images of the kneee joint from a dataset of CT scans from Mendeley Data. Though if possible, I would like to use mice knee joint scans from past projects through my research lab. Either way one of these two datasets will be used.
